## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the OSU AI Bootcamp data sourcing challenge for Module 11. This challenge focuses on analyzing crypto currency series data. The emphasis is on using KMeans and PCA analysis of the data.

## Background
In this Challenge, students were asked to apply our understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, we examined price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

## Files
The file named `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` is the main Jupyter Notebook used to compile the solution for this challenge.

The file named `Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb` is the original Jupyter Notebook supplied to students as a starting point for the challenge. This is stored for reference but it is not used in the final solution.

The directory `Resources` stores the data file supplied to the students for the Challenge.

The file name `README.md` is this Readme file.

## Technical requirements

The code for the Challenge is in `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`. This file is a Jupyter Notebook and requires an appropriate jupyter, pandas, prophet, and python tooling installed. This can include environmental containers such a anaconda, etc. It can also be executed inside of an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. The code requires python 3.10 or greater.

The file `Crypto_Clustering_orig.ipynb` is the original starter file provided for the challenge. It is part of the project for reference only. The directory Resources contains the data file client_dataset.csv provided for the challenge.


## Run the code
Assuming a python interpreter is installed and is at least version 3.10 or greater, the jupyter notebook runtime, and the prophet framework from Meta/Facebook, the program can be executed by calling the jupyter notebook runtime in the directory: E.g., $> jupyter notebook. Once the notebook is running you run each code fragment individually or click on the "Run All" button. It can also be run in Google's Collab.

Alternatively it can be executed from within and IDE if the IDE is configured to run python code and is at least 3.10 compatible and a jupyter notebook runtime is installed.
